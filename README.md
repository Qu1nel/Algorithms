# Welcome

This is another repository-collector of implementations of various algorithms. But this particular algorithm is special in that it stores the implementation in different programming languages, and the implementation of a particular algorithm is not one - there are several of them. Everything is also about data structures

# About Algorithms..

Implementation of Algorithms and data structures in various programming languages. As well as the implementation of trivial tasks in computer science!

## Implemented algorithms:

1. [PrimeNumbers](#PrimeNumbers) - Various algorithms for working with simple numbers, such as checking or finding.

[Show code](algorithms/PrimeNumbers/) <- Implementition on Python, C.

1. Miller-Rabin - Probabilistic test for the primality of a prime number. O(k \* log^3(n))
2. School-Method - Ordinary school algorithm for testing a number for simplicity. O(âˆšn)
