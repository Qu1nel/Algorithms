# Welcome

This is another repository-collector of implementations of various algorithms. But this particular algorithm is special in that it stores the implementation in different programming languages, and the implementation of a particular algorithm is not one - there are several of them. Everything is also about data structures

# About Algorithms..

Implementation of Algorithms and data structures in various programming languages. As well as the implementation of trivial tasks in computer science!

## Implemented algorithms:

### PrimeNumbers

[Show code](./algorithms/Math/PrimeNumbers) ü†ê Implementition on C, Python.

1. **Miller-Rabin** - Probabilistic test for the primality of a prime number. $O\left(k \cdot log^3\left(n\right)\right)$
2. **School-Method** - Ordinary school algorithm for testing a number for simplicity. $O\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$

### FastPower

[Show code](./algorithms/Math/FastPower) ü†ê Implementition on C, Python.

1. **Fast-Power** - Fast degree algorithms (dichotomous degree algorithm, binary degree algorithm) are algorithms designed to raise a number `x` to a natural degree `n` in fewer multiplications than required in the degree definition. $O\left(\lfloor log_2\left(n\right)\rfloor\right)$
