# Welcome

This is another repository-collector of implementations of various algorithms. But this particular algorithm is special in that it stores the implementation in different programming languages, and the implementation of a particular algorithm is not one - there are several of them. Everything is also about data structures

# About Algorithms..

Implementation of Algorithms and data structures in various programming languages. As well as the implementation of trivial tasks in computer science!
